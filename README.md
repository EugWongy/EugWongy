### Hi! I'm Eugene ðŸ‘‹

I believe that data can help take us a long way in making better decisions. Iâ€™m passionate about evidence-based decision making and the practical use of it. My areas of interest lie in the practical application of Welfare and Social Economics- the study of the relationship between resource allocation in society and social well-being.
